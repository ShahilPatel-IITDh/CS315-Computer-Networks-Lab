Write a code using python and socket programming for peer-to-peer communication which has multiple peers (clients) and a single server, The server will be always ON which will maintain the list of currently active peers across the network at all times. The newly arrived client should connect to server, The server adds this newly arrived client to the list of active peers and broadcasts the updated list. The server periodically checks the availability of active peers from its list, updates the list if some client(s) leave(s) the network, and broadcasts the list. The client notifies the server whenever it leaves the networks, the server deletes this client from the list of active clients, and broadcasts the list. The new client is expected to know the know the managerâ€™s IP and port. It pings the manager, and saves the list of active peers sent by the manager, The client also maintains a list of shareable files. Before going offline, a peer informs the manager. To fetch a file from other client, a client broadcasts its requirement to all peers (from its list of active peers). based on received responses, parallely fetches different fragments of the required file from available peers, if any of the transmitting peers go offline, the requesting peer fetches its missing fragments from the remaining available peers, On being requested to share the file by another client a client informs the requesting client of its availability, transmits the requested fragment(s) of one of its shareable files.
